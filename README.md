Bare Application
================
This represents the base for any "micro-service" applications. Just fork it,
add the stuff you want, and off you go !

This was written in php7, so yeah, you may need php7 to continue further. 

No tests are made (yet ?), and this was adapted from a pruned Symfony Framework
Bundle, removing bloated stuff that does not have its place in here, as you
should add those when you see fit.

Stuff integrated
----------------
- Routing
- Commands
- Controllers
- Configuration
- Event handling
- Simple cache

Requirements
------------
- PHP 7
- A bunch of Symfony 3.0 Components (check composer.json)
